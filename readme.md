## Dimensional Data Modeling

- Fact tables are representations of events or transactions and are quantitative
    - Things that happen in the real world
    - They capture the who, what, when, where, and how much about a specific occurrence.
- Dim tables describe the event in a qualitative way
- Bridge ables normalize many to many relationships
    - Patient - Doctor


## .github/workflows 

- Contains CI/CD automated pipeline
- Yaml file(s) used to define list of steps docker container will execute
- Used to deploy to Dev, Stage, and Production
- Allows for automated quick deployments

## app.py

- CDK (Cloud Developer Kit) entry point
- Instantiates stacks from each service and utilizes the constructs to create infrastructure
- Each service has its own stack

```bash
cdk synth
cdk deploy IngestionStack
cdk deploy TransformationStack
```

## cdk.json

- Core configuration
- Tells cdk cli how to run app and can store context values and feature flags (basically configurations)

- Deploy external stages
- Deploy snowpipes to ingest data from S3 into data model

### ./github_oidc_stack/

- Utilizes trusted entity relationship
- Contains github actions construct
- Authenticate utilizing temporary credentials by assuming role

### ./orchestration_stack/
